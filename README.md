This repository contains my work for the assignment of Getting and Cleaning data course.
R script:
I created run_analysis.R to 
1.	Merges the training and test datasets to one dataset.
2.	Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
4.	Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5.	Create a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This tidy dataset is called TidySet.txt which can be found in this repository.
Code Book:
 The code book file describes all the variables and explains the transformations performed.
