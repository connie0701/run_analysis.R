This dataset is from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Data transformation

I extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements

Body = body movement

Gravity = acceleration of gravity

Acc = accelerometer measurement

Gyro = gyroscopic measurement

Jerk = sudden movement acceleration

Mag = magnitude of movement

mean: Mean value

std: Standard deviation

‘XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

"subjectID"  The ID of the test subject                   

"activityID"  The type of activity
